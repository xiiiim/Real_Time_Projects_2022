# Time_Series_Projects_2022

## Business Problem:
The stock price is unstable and it can be affected by many external factors. The objective of this project is to build a model for each stock and analyze each operational transaction with a real-time system to predict the trading price and perform buy and sell operations to achieve an intelligent trading system with stock market in real time.

## Data Description:
  Dimension: 9 variables, 3519 rows
  Data: Semi-structured stocks exchange data
  
In this project, we designed a simple real-time trading system with three main classes - OrderBook, TradingStrategy, and Trademanager to meet objectives of information storage, market prediction, and use all the information sent by the server to make trading decision in order to maximize the profit.

The finance dataset is in the finance folder, and the my_model.py should be ran first to get all the trained models for each stock and all the model files(.pkl) will be saved in the folder models.
